            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
            Our team particularly definitely has set a lot of expectations for ourselves in the future first, or so
            they literally thought, or so they kind of thought. It's funny that sometimes one of my team members
            really mostly generally wants a boyfriend/girlfriend but of course I - Corny won't essentially
            actually let that basically basically happen because our mission literally kind of is so difficult, we
            can't for all intents and purposes really let our hearts generally essentially overshadow our kind
            of pretty own goals in a very definitely major way, showing how our team particularly definitely has
            set a lot of expectations for ourselves in the future first, or so they literally thought, or so they
            actually thought.

                <p><i>Creativity is just connecting things.
                    When you ask creative people how they did something,
                    they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it,
                    they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.</i></p>
